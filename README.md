WL Validfill Project
I'm going to need to add the layout for the RPi touchscreen.
Today we ordered 6) 15521BX cases, 8.8 X 5.5 X 3.6 inches, black plastic.
Need internal standoff structures to support the screen behind a bezel.
Standoffs could be support bars from side to side on the case.
Need 3mm screws for four corners--four per assembly.
Will be building 4 or 5 units for the factory.
